We specialize in isolating and characterizing yeasts that thrive on the bark of Nothofagus trees, unlocking their potential for innovative biotechnological applications. From the targeted generation of hybrid strains adapted for specialized fermentations to the creation of novel products—such as customized yeasts for beer brewing and whisky production—we bridge fundamental research with practical solutions benefiting industry and society."},expertise:{title:"Our Areas of Expertise"},vision:{title:"Our Vision",description:"Our vision is to become a leading laboratory in applied microbial genomics, transforming Patagonia's unique natural resources into sustainable opportunities for the future."}},h={backToHome:"Back to Home",back:"Back"},p={readMore:"Read more",articles:{1:{title:"New research project funded by FONDECYT",excerpt:"Our laboratory has received funding for an innovative three-year project focused on genomic characterization of native Nothofagus yeasts in Chilean Patagonia."},2:{title:"International collaboration with University of California",excerpt:"We establish a strategic alliance with UC Davis for the joint development of yeast strains specialized in craft beer production."},3:{title:"Featured publication in Nature Microbiology",excerpt:"Our study on the genetic diversity of Patagonian yeasts has been published in one of the world's most prestigious scientific journals."},4:{title:"Participation in International Microbiology Congress",excerpt:"The team presented their latest findings at the International Microbiology Congress held in Barcelona, Spain."},5:{title:"Development of new strain for whisky production",excerpt:"We have successfully developed a unique hybrid strain that significantly improves the aromatic profile in Patagonian whisky production."},6:{title:"Recognition for biotechnological innovation",excerpt:"The laboratory received the National Biotechnological Innovation Award for its contributions to the development of sustainable industrial applications."}}},m={title:"Our Team",subtitle:"Meet the researchers and professionals who make our cutting-edge research in molecular genetics and biotechnology possible."},f={title:"Congresses and Conferences",subtitle:"Photo gallery of our participation in international scientific events, where we share our findings and establish collaborations."},y={title:"Outreach & Field Work",subtitle:"Explore our field sampling activities and international collaborations in the study of Patagonian yeasts.",viewAllPhotos:"View All {{count}} Photos",imageCounter:"Image {{current}} of {{total}}",international:{title:"Sampling with International Colleagues",description:"Our laboratory is enriched by frequent visits from our international collaborators, who are experts in the field of yeasts.
