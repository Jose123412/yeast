We specialize in isolating and characterizing yeasts that thrive on the bark of Nothofagus trees, unlocking their potential for innovative biotechnological applications. From the targeted generation of hybrid strains adapted for specialized fermentations to the creation of novel products—such as customized yeasts for beer brewing and whisky production—we bridge fundamental research with practical solutions benefiting industry and society."
